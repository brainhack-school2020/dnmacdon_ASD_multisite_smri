# A template for project reports at BrainHack School

Team contributors: David MacDonald, and anyone else who is interested!

## Summary 

# Project definition 

### Background

I am an elementary school teacher, and currently a Master's student in the [CoBRA Lab](http://cobralab.ca) at McGill University, located at the Douglas Mental Health University Institute, where I study autism and brain anatomy, using structural MRI (sMRI). I have been working with a large, multi-site dataset to examine subcortical anatomy in autism. Multi-site MRI datasets can be difficult to work with, as scans are typically acquired on different equipment, using different protocols, by different operators. In addition, different sites may be sampling different populations. This can result in a dataset in which a significant portion of the variance is due to non-biological factors. Up to now, I have been using meta-analytic techniques to combine the data from the different sites. With this project, I would like to learn and apply two other techniques for inter-site data harmonization:
 * Use the open source ComBat library, which was originally intended to mitigate batch effects in genetic studies, but has since been adapted to work with neuroimaging data.
 * Use linear mixed-effect models. 

I would also like to:
 * Use the tools we have been learning about to make my project more transparent, easy to maintain, reproducible, and open to collaboration.
 * If time permits, find a way to compare these three site harmonization techniques systematically.

### Tools 

This project will make use of:
 * git and github for version control, code sharing, project management, and collaboration
 * Jupyter notebooks
 * Python, including packages for linear regression and mixed models (numpy, statsmodels) and data manipulation (pandas)
 * A virtualization technology, either conda or virtual environment, to improve reproducibility
 * Python libraries for data visualization (matplotlib, Seaborn) 
 * ComBat

### Data 

I will be using subcortical volumes, previously derived from the [ABIDE](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/) dataset using the [MAGeT Brain](https://github.com/CobraLab/MAGeTbrain) pipeline.  
 
### Deliverables

 * github repository containing Jupyter notebooks and the subcortical volume data to be processed
Still under construction...

## Results 

### Progress overview

Coming soon...

### Tools I learned during this project

* git and github, particularly the features for collaboration, including the issue reporting system
* Statistical computation using python
* Data visualization libraries in python
* Virtualization
* ComBat for site harmonization
 
### Results 
Coming soon...

#### Deliverable 1: Coming Soon


#### Deliverable 2: Coming Soon


##### ECG pupilometry pipeline by Marce Kauffmann 

The repository of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/mtl-brainhack-school-2019/ecg_pupillometry_pipeline_kaufmann). The objective was to create a processing pipeline for ECG and pupillometry data. The motivation behind this task is that Marcel's lab (MIST Lab @ Polytechnique Montreal) was conducting a Human-Robot-Interaction user study. The repo features:
 * a [video introduction](http://www.youtube.com/watch/8ZVCNeX42_A) to the project.
 * a presentation [made in a jupyter notebook](https://github.com/mtl-brainhack-school-2019/ecg_pupillometry_pipeline_kaufmann/blob/master/BrainHackPresentation.ipynb) on the results of the project.
 * Notebooks for all analyses.
 * Detailed requirements files, making it easy for others to replicate the environment of the notebook.
 * An overview of the results in the markdown document.

## Conclusion and acknowledgement

The BHS team hope you will find this template helpful in documenting your project. Developping this template was a group effort, and benefitted from the feedback and ideas of all BHS students over the years.
